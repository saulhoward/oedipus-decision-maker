# Oedipus: Decision Maker #
Oedipus is a web based system for describing, recording and analysing conflicts and dramas using [Drama Theoretic Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_Theory).

Go to the Oedipus beta site and start using the software.

## Technical Information ##

The server side of the project has been developed using PHP, [Haddock CMS](http://code.google.com/p/haddock-cms/) and MySQL, using Apache and running on Debian Linux.

## What does it do? ##
This is an example of a Drama Theoretic options table:

![http://beta.oedipus.drama-theory.com/frames/images/frame-6.png](http://beta.oedipus.drama-theory.com/frames/images/frame-6.png)

This table was created by Oedipus. The program allows you to construct such tables, annotate them and compile them into 'Dramas' as an aid to analysing conflicts.

See [Oedipus on the Drama Theory wiki](http://wiki.drama-theory.com/index.php/Oedipus_Decision_Maker) for more examples of using Oedipus to model dramas.

## How can I help? ##

The aim of Oedipus is to make the most user friendly implementation of the Drama Theory model possible, including all of the latest web and internet features (collaboration, syndication etc.).

To this end, we require end users to help with user testing as much as programmers to work on the code.

If you would like to help with either, you can:

  * check out the code
  * start playing around on the demo site
  * get in touch through the [Group](http://groups.google.com/group/oedipus-decision-maker-discuss)
